## Train
You can train SynthText data use

```
python source/train_SynthText.py
```

Dont forget to change your data path.
Testing on Synthetic data it seems not bad even I only trained one epoch on SynthText data. 
I only use one 1080Ti for training, so training for me is really slow. 

## Fine-tuning
unfinished

## Todo
- [ ] val code
- [ ] weakly-supervised learning
